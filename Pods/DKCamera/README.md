Update for Xcode 7 with Swift 2.0
---
## Description
A light weight & simple & easy camera for iOS by Swift. It uses `CoreMotion` framework to detect device orientation, so the screen-orientation lock will be ignored(*Perfect orientation handling*). And it has two other purposes:

* Can be presenting or pushing or Integrating.
* Suppressing the warning **"Snapshotting a view that has not been rendered results in an empty snapshot. Ensure your view has been rendered at least once before snapshotting or snapshot after screen updates."**(It seems a bug in iOS 8).

## Requirements
* iOS 7.1+
* ARC

## Installation
#### iOS 8 and newer
DKCamera is available on Cocoapods. Simply add the following line to your podfile:

```ruby
# For latest release in cocoapods
pod 'DKCamera'
```

#### iOS 7.x
To use Swift libraries on apps that support iOS 7, you must manually copy the files into your application project.
[CocoaPods only supports Swift on OS X 10.9 and newer, and iOS 8 and newer.](https://github.com/CocoaPods/blog.cocoapods.org/commit/6933ae5ccfc1e0b39dd23f4ec67d7a083975836d)

## Easy to use

```swift

let camera = DKCamera()

camera.didCancelled = { () in
    println("didCancelled")
    
    self.dismissViewControllerAnimated(true, completion: nil)
}

camera.didFinishCapturingImage = {(image: UIImage) in
    println("didFinishCapturingImage")
    
    self.dismissViewControllerAnimated(true, completion: nil)
    
    self.imageView?.image = image
}
self.presentViewController(camera, animated: true, completion: nil)

````

### You also can use these APIs:

```swift
public var cameraOverlayView: UIView?

/// The flashModel will to be remembered to next use.
public var flashMode:AVCaptureFlashMode = .Auto

public class func isAvailable() -> Bool
```
